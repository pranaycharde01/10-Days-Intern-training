# Day 4 — Machine Learning

## Objective

Understand basic Machine Learning concepts and build a model to predict facility hygiene risk.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### AI, ML and Deep Learning

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field where machines perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.
- Machine Learning (ML) allows computers to learn patterns from data.
- Deep Learning is a part of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Supervised Learning

The model learns from data that already has a known output or label.

Example:
Predicting whether a facility has Low Risk or High Risk.

### Unsupervised Learning

The model finds patterns in data without predefined labels.

Example:
Grouping similar facilities using K-Means.

### Classification

Classification predicts categories.

Example:

- 0 = Low Risk
- 1 = High Risk

### Regression

Regression predicts numerical values.

Example:

Predicting the number of complaints.

### Features and Labels

Features are the input values used by the model.

Features used in this project:

- cleanliness_score
- odor_score
- waste_level
- complaints
- footfall
- hours_since_cleaning

The label is:

- hygiene_risk

## Training, Validation and Testing

The dataset was divided into:

- 80% training data
- 20% testing data

The model learned patterns from the training data and was evaluated using the testing data.
